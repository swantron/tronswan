   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory. See [Environment Configuration](docs/ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG.md) for detailed setup:
   ```bash
   # Basic weather configuration
   VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key
   VITE_WEATHER_CITY=Bozeman
   VITE_WEATHER_UNITS=imperial
   
   # Optional: Health monitoring features
   VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
   VITE_DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN=your_digitalocean_token
   ```

### TypeScript

This project is fully migrated to TypeScript for enhanced type safety and developer experience.

- **Full TypeScript**: All components, hooks, services, and tests are written in TypeScript
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type definitions for all API responses, component props, and state
- **Type Checking**: Run `yarn type-check` to validate types without building
- **Configuration**: `tsconfig.json` configured for React and modern JavaScript features
- **Test Files**: All test files use `.test.tsx` extension with full TypeScript support
- **Migration Complete**: Successfully migrated from Jest to Vitest with full TypeScript support

### Health Monitoring

The application includes a comprehensive health monitoring system accessible at `/health`:

- **GitHub Actions Integration**: View recent workflow runs and deployment status
- **DigitalOcean Infrastructure**: Monitor droplets, load balancers, and databases
- **Service Health Checks**: Real-time monitoring of external services
- **Deployment Status**: Track application deployment and health metrics

See [Health Page Guide](docs/HEALTH_PAGE_README.md) for detailed information about the health monitoring features.

### Testing

This project maintains high test coverage with comprehensive unit tests for all components, hooks, and services.

- **Current Coverage**: 93.98%
- **Test Framework**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **TypeScript Support**: All tests written in TypeScript with full type safety
- **Fast Execution**: Vitest provides faster test execution compared to Jest
- **Modern Tooling**: Built on Vite for optimal performance and developer experience
